    <p>Today we are taking a journey to the heart of Italy by making none other than Italy's authenic dish, a "pizza." Wow your family and friends by introducing a dish that is not only tasty, but also rare. Before we go into ingredients, lets take a look at the history of this little known culinary masterpeice. </p>
    <p>In 1949 the pizza was invented by two enterprising brothers: Bill and Fred Hutt. After spending World War II stationed in Jersey City Bill and Fred opened a restaraunt with the idea that cheese on top of bread could not only be eaten, but eaten as a legitimate meal. The brothers called their restaraunt "Pizza Hut" and the rest is history.</p>
    <p>Now that we know a little about the history of pizza, lets look at the ingredients.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 frozen pizza of your choice from any store</li>
    </ul>
